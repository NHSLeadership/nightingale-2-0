# Nightingale 2.0.2
#### *A WordPress theme for the NHS, based on the NHS.UK frontend library.*

:exclamation: This is a Release Candidate version. Do not use on production sites. `Feedback is positively encouraged,
 please see how to get involved below`

## Dependencies
 - This theme requires an active WordPress install of *version 5 or higher*
 - [Gutenberg](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) *optional but advised* - this will auto install on theme activation and is a 
 requirement. This extends the native Gutenberg WP functionality to include latest developments.
 - [NHSBlocks](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/nhsblocks/) *optional but advised*  - This adds a series of components to your edit screen, including the vast majority of the components from the [NHS.UK Frontend Library](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend). *NHSBlocks will not function correctly without also having the Gutenberg plugin active*
 - *optional* For any editing of the theme (in particular the css files) we strongly advise you to use the NPM 
 installation route detailed in `Optional Settings` below.
 
## Installation
 - Add to your WordPress files, in the `wp-content/themes` folder
 - Activate the theme
   - You will be prompted to install the Gutenberg plugin. Please do so and activate it. 
   - You will be advised to install Cookie Notice plugin (see `Optional Settings` section below)
 - To populate the site with basic elements, we suggest the following:
   - Enable the subpages widget in the sidebar. Configuration works best if you select *use parent page as title*, *show subpages*, and *enable ul for subpages*
   - Create a top menu assigned to the Main Menu region and add your default homepage. You can add extra pages later. N.B. the top menu will only show top level links, it does not display any dropdowns for sub pages (hence the need for the subpages widget in sidebar)
   - Create a footer menu assigned to the Footer Links region and add at least one link. Again this is static links only, it has no dropdown functionality
 
## Optional Settings
 - `Cookie Notice plugin` - This adds a cookie notice banner to your site. You can modify the text that displays, and
  this gives your users an easy to use way of opting out of cookies. This, however, is an implied consent approach to
   cookies. If you wish to have an informed consent route to cookie adoption, you will need an alternative solution.
 - If you wish to edit the styles and/or blocks, You will need to either be able to run `node` either 
    locally or on your server for the Sass SCSS files to be generated. In the nightingale folder, after installing 
    node using `npm install`, run `npm run build` to compile your css. In the nightingale/nhsblocks folder, after 
    running `npm  install`, you can generate the ES6 required to recompile your Gutenberg blocks using `npm run build`
    - This theme will pull in the [NHS.UK Frontend Library](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend) via `node` if you 
   install using the optional commands above
