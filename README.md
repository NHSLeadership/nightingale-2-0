#### *A WordPress theme for the NHS, based on the NHS.UK frontend library.*
:exclamation: 2.1.0 - For WP theme review compliance, certain elements have been modified in this release
. Performance tweaks, the NHS logo being displayed by default and the Frutiger font have all been removed. Please be
 aware of this before updating, and recognise you may need to modify your customiser settings after upgrade to keep
  your site looking the same
  
:exclamation: Updates to 2.0.7 will make the header region revert to standard wordpress values. If updating your theme, please pay particular attention to the site identity and header regions of the theme customiser before making your site live.

:exclamation: This is a production ready release, with the caveat that any issues should be reported as an issue on 
this repo for quick action. 
`Feedback is positively encouraged,
 please see how to get involved below`
 
### Frutiger Font ###
The Frutiger font is specified for use on NHS web properties, but is only licensed for sites ending .nhs.uk - if your
 site is both an NHS property and is on the correct domain, you can add this back in by making your own child theme
  and adding in the below font declarations to a .scss file.
  ```@font-face {
  font-family: 'Frutiger W01';
  font-display: swap;
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: url('https://assets.nhs.uk/fonts/FrutigerLTW01-55Roman.eot?#iefix');
  src: url('https://assets.nhs.uk/fonts/FrutigerLTW01-55Roman.eot?#iefix') format('eot'),
       url('https://assets.nhs.uk/fonts/FrutigerLTW01-55Roman.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('https://assets.nhs.uk/fonts/FrutigerLTW01-55Roman.woff') format('woff'),
       url('https://assets.nhs.uk/fonts/FrutigerLTW01-55Roman.ttf') format('truetype'),
       url('https://assets.nhs.uk/fonts/FrutigerLTW01-55Roman.svg#7def0e34-f28d-434f-b2ec-472bde847115') format('svg');
}
@font-face {

  font-display: swap;
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 600;
  src: url('https://assets.nhs.uk/fonts/FrutigerLTW01-65Bold.eot?#iefix');

       url('https://assets.nhs.uk/fonts/FrutigerLTW01-65Bold.woff') format('woff'),
       url('https://assets.nhs.uk/fonts/FrutigerLTW01-65Bold.ttf') format('truetype'),

## Dependencies
 - This theme requires an active WordPress install of *version 5 or higher*
 - *optional* For any editing of the theme (in particular the css files) we strongly advise you to use the NPM 
 installation route detailed in `Optional Settings` below.
 
## Installation
 - Add to your WordPress files, in the `wp-content/themes` folder
 - Activate the theme
   - You will be prompted to install the Gutenberg plugin. Please do so and activate it. 
   - You will be prompted to install the NHS Blocks plugin. Please do so and activate it.
   - You will be advised to install Cookie Notice plugin (see `Optional Settings` section below)
 - To populate the site with basic elements, we suggest the following:
   - Enable the subpages widget in the sidebar. Configuration works best if you select *use parent page as title*, *show subpages*, and *enable ul for subpages*
   - Create a top menu assigned to the Main Menu region and add your default homepage. You can add extra pages later. N.B. the top menu will only show top level links, it does not display any dropdowns for sub pages (hence the need for the subpages widget in sidebar)
   - Create a footer menu assigned to the Footer Links region and add at least one link. Again this is static links only, it has no dropdown functionality
 - Userguide for theme customiser and options is available at https://digital.leadershipacademy.nhs.uk/digital-capabilities/websites/nightingale-theme-user-guide/
 
## Optional Settings
 - `Cookie Notice plugin` - This adds a cookie notice banner to your site. You can modify the text that displays, and
  this gives your users an easy to use way of opting out of cookies. This, however, is an implied consent approach to
   cookies. If you wish to have an informed consent route to cookie adoption, you will need an alternative solution.
 - This theme will suggest you pull in the [NHS.UK Frontend Library](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend) via 
    `node` if you install using the optional commands above
 - [Gutenberg](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) - this will be prompted as a suggested install on theme 
     activation and is a requirement for the NHS Blocks plugin. This extends the native Gutenberg WP functionality to 
     include latest developments.
- [Google Tag Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duracelltomi-google-tag-manager/) - This is an easy way to install the Google Tag Manager code
  on your site. Once installed and activated go to Settings -> Google Tag Manager and enter your Google Tag Manager ID in the box. Under 'Container code placement'
  choose 'Custom (needs tweak in your template)'. You don't need to add anything else to the theme as this code has been added for you.
     
      
## Feedback / Improvement / Development
 - If you see any issues, faults or have suggestions for improvements, please add them as issues to our Git 
 repository so we can action them.
 - If you have developed improvements, please consider giving back to the Open Source community by submitting them as
  pull requests to this repository
  
## Developing this theme's styling output
##### if you are developing this theme locally, any style changes you make will need to be reflected in the output
To accomplish this, you will need to take the following steps:
 - Install npm locally `npm install`
 - Compile the css from all the downstream libraries and local files `npm run build`
 - Compress the css output `npm run compress`
 - Regenerate the critical css `npm run critical`
 ##### Alternatively, if you only wish to modify minimal css for a single site, you can use the Custom CSS section within the theme customiser section.
   
## Please note
 - XML/RPC is still enabled - this is a WordPress default, but will trigger National Cyber Security Centre monitoring alerts. To disable XML-RPC you can add:
```add_filter('xmlrpc_enabled', '__return_false');```
To your themes functions.php file, or if your hosting permits you can disable/block it at server level.
