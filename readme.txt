== Description ==

A responsive and accessible theme for NHS organisations based on the NHSUK Frontend Library.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this on any NHS website? =
Yes, the only restriction being that you need to have WordPress running first :)

= Can I use it on a non NHS website =
Yes, it is open source code and can be used anywhere. However, you may not use the NHS logo or pass your site off as an NHS organisation if you are not.

= Do you offer support? =
Yes, either through the themes support pages on WordPress, or via our GitHub project https://github.com/NHSLeadership/nightingale-2-0/

= Can I get involved? =
Yes - please do! Whether you work in the NHS or would just like to contribute, we are happy to involve the wider
community in this work and will consider any pull requests or code snippets you are happy to contribute.

= How do I customise my 404 page? =
All content on the 404 error page is widgetised. Navigate to admin > appearance > widgets and add your chosen widgets and content to the `404 page` widget.

= How does the menu system work? =
The top level navigation has NO dropdowns or expander functionality. This is by design. This means your header menu is
one level only. To show further levels, we recommend using the right (or left) hand column and adding a menu widget. You
 can either use your own custom menu, or the subpages widget included with the theme.

 = What is the subpages widget =
 The subpages widget shows pages  in the current navigation tree. When you add the widget, you can configure how this
 behaves and whether the top level page is linked etc.

== Changelog

 * inline style removed, all styles now loaded in standalone css
 * colours apply to all inner blocks, menus and content automatically
 * colours applied top gravity elements where relevant

Header element changes:

 benefit)
 * Added filters to enable post author, post date and post thumbnail to be suppressed on individual post pages
 * learndash styling improvements
 * menu button floating issues resolved in mobile view
 * Frutiger font stubborn remnants removed.
 * Search and input boxes styling bought into alignment with nhsuk styling principles
 * Weird shadow removed from header buttons
 * Search results page now shows in nice panels and looks a lot more akin to the rest of the site display
= 2.1.4 =
 * nhsuk frontend called in using new nhsuk-replacement.scss (previously there were duplicate calls to a file making the
  output css contain duplicates and also bypassing my removal of the frutiger font loading)
 * textdomain corrected
 * readmore function completely removed along with any references to it.

= 2.1.3 =
 * Readmore function in template-functions.php now returns null. 99% certain this is now deprecated and can be removed,
 but for safety left in with a zero return.

 * Internationalisation added back in (in potential)
 * wp_open_body function added to header.php for better alignment with other wp functionality

= 2.1.2 =

 * Corrected some minor styling issues with learndash css
 * Corrected hover color from warm-yellow to focus-color for consistency
 * Added filter to copyright to pick up organisation name if defined.
 * Updated theme to reflect compatability with wp 5.4

= 2.1.1 =

= 2.1.0 =
Removed for theme review compliance:
 * Performance optimisations and code standard changes. These have been removed as are considered plugin options. These
 will be added to a companion plugin at a later date.
 * All references to assets.nhs.uk - the font that was originally bundled (Frutiger) is only licensed for use on nhs.uk
   domains. If you are able to use Frutiger, you will need to add the relevant css to your customiser css section. For a
   WordPress release it was not appropriate to include it bundled.
 * All dev files. These are now in our github repo version only. The WP theme version is only the files required topower
  the theme. If you would like to be involved in developing the theme you are more than welcome, but please download the
   full repo from github to get the full upline files (such as node_files)

Fixed search button operation on mobile.
